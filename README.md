# Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting

This repository is the official implementation of Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for
Multivariate Time-series Forecasting.

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials -->

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc... -->

## Training and Evaluation

The training procedure and evaluation procedure are all included in the `main.py`. To train and evaluate on some dataset, run the following command:

```train & evaluate
python main.py --dataset <path_to_data>
```

<!-- The hyperparameters are set as default pramaters for reproduction convenience, so no more parameters need to be specified in the above command. -->

## Datasets

[METR-LA](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[PEMS-BAY](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[PEMS03](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[PEMS04](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[PEMS07](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[PEMS08](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/?dnode=Clearinghouse&type=station_5min&district_id=3&submit=Submit),
[Solar](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-power-data.html),
[Electricity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014),
[ECG](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000)

Since complex reorganizations need to be conducted on the above datasets provided in the urls before fed into StemGNN model, we provide a organized version of PEMS07 ([./dataset/PeMS07.csv](./dataset/PeMS07.csv)) for reproduction convenience. The PeMS07.csv is in shape of `T*N`, where `T` denotes total number of timestamps, `N` denotes number of nodes.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on the 3 datasets included in the code repo:


| Evaluation Method | Dataset 1  | Dataset 2 | Dataset 3 |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |  -------------- |
| MAE  | xxx | xxx | xxx |
| RMSE | xxx | xxx | xxx |
| MAPE | xxx | xxx | xxx |

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.  -->
