# Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting

This repository is the official implementation of Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for
Multivariate Time-series Forecasting.

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials -->

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc... -->

## Training and Evaluation

The training procedure and evaluation procedure are all included in the `main.py`. To train and evaluate on some dataset, run the following command:

```train & evaluate
python main.py --dataset <path_to_data>
```

The hyperparameters are set as default pramaters for reproduction convenience, so no more parameters need to be specified in the above command.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on the 3 datasets included in the code repo:

| Evaluation Method | Dataset 1  | Dataset 2 | Dataset 3 |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |  -------------- |
| MAE  | xxx | xxx | xxx |
| RMSE | xxx | xxx | xxx |
| MAPE | xxx | xxx | xxx |

<!-- > ðŸ“‹Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.  -->
